# <u>*Recommendations*</u>

1. Customers with Grade A are the most reliable on the repayments. Bank can extend the credit line to these customers and should focus and adding more new customers to list of borrowers. 93% of these have a track record of repaying their loan.

2. The term period of 60 months is a trouble when it comes to Charged Off accounts. 32% of accounts from 60 months term period turned into NPA based on the data available. So, here needs to rethink on the repayment terms.

3. The median annual income of Charged Off customers is 59K which is 6K less than median annual income of Fully Paid customers (65K). Please revisit the annual income thresholds while extending the credit lines to the customers.

4. The median dti ratio of Charged Off customers is 19.34 which is 3 points higher than the fully paid customers. Please give it a thought. This feature tops in first 5 most impactful features.

5. 37% of the grade E and 28% of the grade D customers are defaulters from historical data. The needs to put more stringent criteria and the grade E and D customers.

6. Median interest rates of defaulter customers are 2.62% higher than those of regular. Median interest rate of regualr customers is 12.99% and for defaulters it's found that median interest rate is 15.61%. If the customer interest rates crawl above the alarming thresholds then that account is more probably more prone to become an NPA

7. Apart from this, the bank needs to focus more on improving the precision of correctly identifying the Charged Off customer. Becuase the current historical data trend shows that the bank is not so accurate in classifying the Charged Off customers. However these customers often get the green pass as a result of high FPR (False Positive Rate).
